This PHP-powered CMS and website was created for the artist Becca DeWitt. A few of nice things: (1) There's a SQL abstraction layer; (2) There's a nice image resize script that almost totally works; (3) there are dynamically generated CREATE and UPDATEâ€”only one script for all of the models; (4) there's some coffeescript that automatically resizes the thumbnails based on the window size; (5) there's a full-screen background (also coffeescript). Enjoy!
